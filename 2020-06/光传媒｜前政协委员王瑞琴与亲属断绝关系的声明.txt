Public Declaration by CPPCC Former Member Wang Ruiqin Denouncing Relations with Her Relatives
June 22, 2020
I am Wang Ruiqin, a citizen of the People’s Republic of China. After I sent “an Open Letter to Delegates of the National People’s Congress and CPPCC Members” on May 21, 2020 during the Two Sessions, my families and relatives have been maliciously and intentionally harassed and even seriously affected their normal daily work and life. In addition, my company’s assets were frozen, and all financial bills and operation were detained for inspection.
Because of this situation, I would like to make a solemn statement as such, that I have severed relations with all relatives and no longer have contacts with them, including but not only limited to the following: children and their families; all siblings and their families; all blood-related relatives and their families.
I pursue democracy and oppose tyranny. All the words and deeds involved are my personal behaviors and have nothing to do with others. I will full responsibility for this. Please do not bother the innocent people since such actions are to be despised, and shall not work.
Hereby I make this declaration.
Wang Ruiqin
